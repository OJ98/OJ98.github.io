Hello! I am a graduate student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) at [NC State](https://www.ncsu.edu/), pursuing a *Master's Degree in Computer Science*. My research primarily focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Security, and Argumentation in NLP. Currently, I am working on a project that explores LLM-driven MultiAgent Protocols under the guidance of [Dr. Munindar Singh](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing board games and taking part in quizzes. I am also an active participant in [International British Parliamentary debates](/files/Debate_Resume_Omkar.pdf), with several wins as both a debater and adjudicator. My passion for debate was instrumental in igniting my initial interest in Argumentation.

I am always excited to discuss/collaborate on any projects or ideas. Please reach out to me at ojjoshi@ncsu.edu or on my LinkedIn!
