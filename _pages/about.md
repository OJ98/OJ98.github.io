Hello, there! I am a *Masters in CS student* in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) at [NC State](https://www.ncsu.edu/). My primary research focus lies at intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Security and Argumentation in NLP. My current projects investigate the application of LLMs to the task of generating phishing HTMLs, advised by [Dr. Alexandros Kapravelos](https://kapravelos.com/). 

I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science (CS) from [College of Engineering, Pune (now COEP Technological University)](https://www.coeptech.ac.in/). I have also collaborated with [Dr Henning Wachsmuth (Leibniz University Hannover)](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/en/institute/staff/henning-wachsmuth) and [Dr Collin Lynch (NC State University)](https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/arglab/people/cflynch.html) during my MS. 

In my personal time, I like to play board games and participate in quizzes. I was an [International British Parliamentary debater](/files/debate_resume.pdf) from 2017-2023, with multiple wins and breaks as a debater and adjudicator. Debating played a pivotal role in sparking my initial interest in argumentation within NLP. 

I am always excited to discuss/collaborate on any , please reach out to me at ojjoshi@ncsu.edu or on my LinkedIn!
